This repo contains all the code I wrote for my bachelor thesis. I used two different R packages: biomod2 and machuruku. Unfortunately, I cannot provide the species presence data as they do not belong to me. All the climate data come from https://www.worldclim.org as well as http://www.paleoclim.org.
